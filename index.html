                <h3>Augusta Ada King <span class="highlight">
                        Countess of Lovelace</span></h3>
                <p>was a mathematician and writer, known for her work on Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
                    She was the first to recognise that the
                    machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended
                    to be carried out by a machine. She is regarded as
                    <em>the first computer programmer.</em>
